Letterpress Cheater
==================

A program that finds all possible words, given a string of characters. 

To use, simply run the program and pass the characters that can be used through stdin. Normally the program uses the dictionary at /usr/share/dict/words, to use your own just pass the name of the dictionary file as a parameter, like ./letterpress dict.txt
